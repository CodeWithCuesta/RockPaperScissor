# RockPaperScissor

### This is my interactive adaptiation of RockPaperScissors
- User plays against the computer in a best of 5 challenge.
- First player to reach 3 wins is the winner of the game.
- Rounds will continue until winner is declared, Ties do not count as a round.
- Game can be reset at anypoint of the game if you don't feel like loosing to a computer.
